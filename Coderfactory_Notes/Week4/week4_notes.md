# Week 4 Notes!

##Monday

### Presenting project apps

Tanim's app was probably the most rounded / full featured: https://github.com/tanimmahmud/Banking-App

## HTML and CSS

Each HTML tag has a key / attribute.
EG. img can have src key, and /images/cat.jpg attribute <img src='images/cat.jpg'>

Use the Chrome Developer Tools (inspect) to adjust colours within the browser.

use a hash for ID's,
use a . for classes
