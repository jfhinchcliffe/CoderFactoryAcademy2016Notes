Exercise 22: What Do You Know So Far?

There won't be any code in this exercise or the next one, so there's no What You Should See or Study Drills either. In fact, this exercise is like one giant Study Drills. I'm going to have you do a review of what you have learned so far.

First, go back through every exercise you have done so far and write down every word and symbol (another name for "character") that you have used. Make sure your list of symbols is complete.

== : is the same as
!= : doesn't equal the same as
<= : less than or equal to
>= : greater than or equal to
< : less than
> : greater than
#basic method structure
def functionname(variable1, variable2)
  puts variable1
  puts variable2
end

"string"
["this", "is", "a", "hash"]
[["this", "is"],["also", "a hash"]]
{key: "value", this: "is", hash: "yes"}
1 is an int
1.23 is a float
